# AI-Augmented Full-Stack Engineering Training

**Welcome to the AI-Augmented Full-Stack Engineering training.**

By the end of this self-paced program, you will not just "learn" about full-stack development—you will become a practitioner. Your journey includes:

1. **Full-Stack Real-World Projects:** You will architect and build two distinct production systems (A Deterministic CRUD System and an AI-Integrated Capstone).
2. **Resume Transformation:** You will rewrite your CV to reflect in-demand skills like "AI-Assisted TDD," "Spring Boot & Angular Architecture".
3. **Technical Defense:** You will undergo rigorous technical vetting (Code Reviews and Mock Interviews) to master your storytelling and technical defense.

**This course is self-directed.** You are responsible for managing your own learning timeline (est. 8–10 hrs/week) and coordinating with colleagues for your review.

## 💰 Free Tier & Usage Notes

### Get Copilot for Free

For any GitHub user you can get copilot for free. It requires no credit card and no application.

1. **Sign In:** Log into your GitHub account on the web.
2. **IDE Setup:** Open VS Code or Visual Studio.
3. **Install Extension:** Search the Marketplace for "GitHub Copilot."
4. **Activate:** Click the profile icon in the bottom left of your IDE and select **"Sign in with GitHub to use Copilot."**
5. **Status:** You will be automatically enrolled in the **Copilot Free** plan.

- **Important:** As of 2026, GitHub offers a **Free Tier** that includes **2,000 code completions** and **50 Chat/Premium requests** per month.

#### Best Practices to use the Free Tier
* **Use "Inline Completions" for boilerplate**, but **save your "Chat" requests for complex refactoring** to avoid hitting the 50-request cap on the Free plan.
* Completions are the "ghost" suggestions that appear as you type. **Each time you press Tab to accept a suggestion, it counts.**
* **Turn Off "Auto-Trigger":** By default, Copilot suggests code constantly. Go to your IDE settings and set it to manual or use a keyboard shortcut to trigger suggestions. This prevents "wasting" completions on simple things you could have typed yourself (like a public class declaration).
* Try to **trigger suggestions specifically for complex logic** rather than simple boilerplate.
* **Pause When Not Coding**: If you are just reading code or writing documentation in Markdown, disable Copilot via the status bar icon. This stops accidental completions from eating your 2,000-count quota.
* **Plan Before You Chat**: Never ask "Why isn't this working?" without context. That costs one request. Instead, gather your error logs and the relevant code first.
* **Use Multi-Turn Chats Wisely**: A "session" usually counts per prompt. If you can get the answer in one long, well-structured prompt (e.g., "Review this Java controller for security AND generate a unit test"), you save a request compared to asking for them separately.
* **Avoid "Agent Mode" for Small Fixes**: The Coding Agent (which edits multiple files) is powerful but can consume multiple "credits" in one go. Stick to standard Chat for simple refactoring.

## 🎯 Program Mission

The objective is to transition from *traditional backend development* to **AI-augmented full-stack engineering**. You will master:

* **The Stack:** Spring Boot (Backend), Angular (Frontend), GitHub Codespaces (Environment).
* **The Accelerator:** GitHub Copilot for code generation, complex refactoring, and automated testing.

## 🟢 Phase 1: The AI-Native Foundation

### 💰 Free Tier & Usage Notes

#### Copilot Free

This is the default for any GitHub user. It requires no credit card and no application.

1. **Sign In:** Log into your GitHub account on the web.
2. **IDE Setup:** Open VS Code or Visual Studio.
3. **Install Extension:** Search the Marketplace for "GitHub Copilot."
4. **Activate:** Click the profile icon in the bottom left of your IDE and select **"Sign in with GitHub to use Copilot."**
5. **Status:** You will be automatically enrolled in the **Copilot Free** plan.

- **GitHub Copilot Free:** As of 2026, GitHub offers a **Free Tier** for individuals. It includes **2,000 code completions** and **50 Chat/Premium requests** per month.
- **Best Practice:** Use "Inline Completions" for boilerplate, but save your "Chat" requests for complex refactoring to avoid hitting the 50-request cap on the Free plan.

**Mission:** Stop coding manually. Start coding intentionally. You will configure your AI environment and master the art of prompt engineering to accelerate your velocity.

**Deliverables:**

* **Environment:** GitHub Copilot installed in VS Code.
* **Skill Check:** Demonstrate "Comment-to-code," inline autocomplete, and Chat refactoring.
* **Drill:** Use Copilot to generate unit tests for a legacy Java controller.

**Key Resources:**

* [Fundamentals of Generative AI (Microsoft Learn)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/fundamentals-generative-ai/)
* [Prompt Engineering with GitHub Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-prompt-engineering-with-github-copilot/)
* [Accelerate App Dev with GitHub Copilot – Module 1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/accelerate-app-development-using-github-copilot/)

## 🟦 Phase 2: Angular Architecture & Deferrable Views

**Mission:** Break the backend mindset. You will learn component-based architecture and modern frontend performance patterns.

**Deliverables:**

* **Project 1 (Alpha):** Build a To-Do application using the `First App` tutorial.
* **Tech Stack:** TypeScript, HTML/CSS, `@defer` blocks.
* **AI Integration:** Use Copilot to scaffold components and services instantly.

## 🚀 Phase 5 & 6: The Capstone (Innovation & AI Integration)

**Mission:** Build something helpful, creative, or fun. Do not build a tutorial app. You must design a unique product, architect the API, and inject an "AI Magic" feature.

**The Challenge:**
Choose a domain (e.g., Smart Travel, Corporate Knowledge Base, Recipe Vault) and build a production-grade application.
Example application:
* https://github.com/AlucardMZT/AshopBack
* https://github.com/AlucardMZT/AshopUI
  

**Required Specs:**

1. **Backend:** Spring Boot with complex business logic.
2. **Frontend:** Angular UI with Material Design.
3. **The AI Feature:** Integrate an AI API (e.g., OpenAI/Gemini) for features like summarization, recommendation, or generation.
4. **UX:** The AI must add value, not just novelty.

**Key Resources:**

* [OpenAI API Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/)
* [From Zero to Wow: Angular + GPT App](https://dev.to/this-is-angular/from-zero-to-wow-building-a-beginner-friendly-angular-gpt-powered-app-1j1n)

## 🏁 Phase 7: Technical Defense & Wrap-Up

**Mission:** Prepare for the scrutiny of senior engineering leadership.

**Final Deliverables:**

* **Code Quality:** Full refactoring pass using Copilot Chat recommendations.
* **Documentation:** A professional `README.md` for your Capstone.
* **The Mock Interview:** Present your Capstone to your peers/manager. Defend your architectural choices, explain your prompt engineering strategy, and demonstrate the "AI Magic" live.

### ✅ Graduation Criteria

You are considered a practitioner when you have:

1. **Shipped** the Capstone project to a repository.
2. **Passed** the Technical Defense interview.
3. **Updated** your internal CV to reflect your new capabilities in AI-Augmented Engineering.

Happy building. 🚀
