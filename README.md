# AI-Augmented Full-Stack Engineering Training

**Welcome to the AI-Augmented Full-Stack Engineering training.**

By the end of this self-paced program, you will not just "learn" about full-stack development—you will become a practitioner. Your journey includes:

1. **Full-Stack Real-World Projects:** You will architect and build two distinct production systems (A Deterministic CRUD System and an AI-Integrated Capstone).
2. **Resume Transformation:** You will rewrite your CV to reflect in-demand skills like "AI-Assisted TDD," "Spring Boot & Angular Architecture".
3. **Technical Defense:** You will undergo rigorous technical vetting (Code Reviews and Mock Interviews) to master your storytelling and technical defense.

**This course is self-directed.** You are responsible for managing your own learning timeline (est. 8–10 hrs/week) and coordinating with colleagues for your review.

## 🎯 Program Mission

The objective is to transition from *traditional backend development* to **AI-augmented full-stack engineering**. You will master:

* **The Stack:** Spring Boot (Backend), Angular (Frontend), GitHub Codespaces (Environment).
* **The Accelerator:** GitHub Copilot for code generation, complex refactoring, and automated testing.

---

## 🟢 Phase 1: The AI-Native Foundation

**Mission:** Stop coding manually. Start coding intentionally. You will configure your AI environment and master the art of prompt engineering to accelerate your velocity.

**Deliverables:**

* **Environment:** GitHub Copilot installed in VS Code.
* **Skill Check:** Demonstrate "Comment-to-code," inline autocomplete, and Chat refactoring.
* **Drill:** Use Copilot to generate unit tests for a legacy Java controller.

**Key Resources:**

* [Fundamentals of Generative AI (Microsoft Learn)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/fundamentals-generative-ai/)
* [Prompt Engineering with GitHub Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-prompt-engineering-with-github-copilot/)

---

## 🟦 Phase 2: Angular Architecture & Deferrable Views

**Mission:** Break the backend mindset. You will learn component-based architecture and modern frontend performance patterns.

**Deliverables:**

* **Project 1 (Alpha):** Build a To-Do application using the `First App` tutorial.
* **Tech Stack:** TypeScript, HTML/CSS, `@defer` blocks.
* **AI Integration:** Use Copilot to scaffold components and services instantly.

**Key Resources:**

* [Learn Angular (Interactive Tutorial)](https://angular.dev/tutorials/learn-angular)
* [Deferrable Views Tutorial](https://angular.dev/tutorials/learn-angular/10-deferrable-views)

---

## 🟦 Phase 3: The Full-Stack Nexus (Java + Angular)

**Mission:** Connect the dots. You will build a cohesive system where a Spring Boot backend talks seamlessly to an Angular frontend, underpinned by rigorous testing.

**Deliverables:**

* **Project 1 (Final):** A complete User Management CRUD System.
* **Architecture:** Async Services, REST Controllers, and JPA Repositories.
* **Quality Gate:** 100% Unit Test coverage generated via Copilot-assisted TDD.

**Key Resources:**

* [Building a RESTful Web Service](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service)
* [Consuming a RESTful Web Service](https://spring.io/guides/gs/consuming-rest)

---

## 🟦 Phase 4: Cloud-Native Workflow

**Mission:** Eliminate "it works on my machine." You will standardize your development environment using cloud containers.

**Deliverables:**

* **Environment:** a customized `devcontainer.json` for Java/Node/Angular.
* **Workflow:** Execute all git commands (branching, PRs) via GitHub CLI.

**Key Resources:**

* [Setting up Java Projects in GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/setting-up-your-java-project-for-codespaces)
* [GitHub CLI Manual](https://cli.github.com/manual/)

---

## 🚀 Phase 5 & 6: The Capstone (Innovation & AI Integration)

**Mission:** Build something helpful, creative, or fun. Do not build a tutorial app. You must design a unique product, architect the API, and inject an "AI Magic" feature.

**The Challenge:**
Choose a domain (e.g., Smart Travel, Corporate Knowledge Base, Recipe Vault) and build a production-grade application.

**Required Specs:**

1. **Backend:** Spring Boot with complex business logic.
2. **Frontend:** Angular UI with Material Design.
3. **The AI Feature:** Integrate an AI API (e.g., OpenAI/Gemini) for features like summarization, recommendation, or generation.
4. **UX:** The AI must add value, not just novelty.

**Key Resources:**

* [OpenAI API Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/)
* [From Zero to Wow: Angular + GPT App](https://dev.to/this-is-angular/from-zero-to-wow-building-a-beginner-friendly-angular-gpt-powered-app-1j1n)

---

## 🏁 Phase 7: Technical Defense & Wrap-Up

**Mission:** Prepare for the scrutiny of senior engineering leadership.

**Final Deliverables:**

* **Code Quality:** Full refactoring pass using Copilot Chat recommendations.
* **Documentation:** A professional `README.md` for your Capstone.
* **The Mock Interview:** Present your Capstone to your peers/manager. Defend your architectural choices, explain your prompt engineering strategy, and demonstrate the "AI Magic" live.

### ✅ Graduation Criteria

You are considered a practitioner when you have:

1. **Shipped** the Capstone project to a repository.
2. **Passed** the Technical Defense interview.
3. **Updated** your internal CV to reflect your new capabilities in AI-Augmented Engineering.

Happy building. 🚀
